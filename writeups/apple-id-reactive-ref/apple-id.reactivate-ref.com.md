# What is phishing?
Phishing is a type of cyber attack that involves using fake emails, websites, or other online communication to trick users into revealing sensitive information such as usernames, passwords, credit card numbers, or other personal or financial data. Phishing attacks often rely on social engineering tactics to create a sense of urgency or importance, and may use realistic-looking emails or websites to deceive users into thinking they are legitimate. Phishing attacks can be highly effective and are a common method used by cyber criminals to steal valuable data and gain unauthorized access to networks and systems. The criminals will spray many thousands of users but only need a small percentage of victims to fall for the attack for their campaigns to be lucrative.
