# Smishing and Phishing Campaign Analysis
This is where I store write-ups and technical analysis on smishing and phishing campaigns that I receive.

#### DISCLAIMER!
⋅⋅⋅*I do not claim to be an expert in anything, at all*. I barely know what I am doing here. This is a place for me to write my findings as I learn. I am currently studying Offensive Security's OSCP and WEB-200 materials and am using this research as a means to learn/stretch and have fun. Also, my words are my own and .⋅⋅⋅
